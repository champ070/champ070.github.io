            <p>"so its the end of this site and most amazing day.....happy birthday once again.....and below are some things you know kya hogi...
           
           \believe me , mujhe nai pta where we are , or kya hoga, but nothing gonna change my feeling , or anything for you about you, i just cant stop myself from coming near you and not even a cent i want to go away, i can be here without even wanting anything from you. .. my worst mistake was expecting too much and not understanding you and maybe forcing you then to change .......to act according to what i want......
          it doesnt hurt , it kills knowing that we cant be together and even more when we are not....and believe me at starting maybe i did, but now i dont , i dont blame you...i just love you....and knowing about you, hearing you seeing you all this is the thing that makes me smile and give the pleasure most....not most but one of the most...
          
          and idk why, whenever i say its upto you, you immediately say ki chalo abse baat nai krnge and den i thinnk is this you want or maybe you are saying just becoz maine bola tumhe aisa and mai jana chaha hun or tumhara haq nai rokne ka islye ....
          
          believe me , im not tired enough and i want to stay...han shyad baar baar puchra kyuki last time bhi socha tha nai i will be able to do what you will say, but i freaked out and couldnt control.
          
          so i have chosen this....if you just waant to be this abhi k loiye, just want to enjoy this , future m theek hua to theek nai hua to bhi theek , chahti ho aise hi pareshan krta rahu......to send me a good morniong text tomorrow....
          
          or chutkaara chahti ho to na bhjna........or agar time mile possible ho to confirmation k lioye ek bar duo krlena , wont say or ask anything...bas tumhe ek bar achche se dekh lunga or kuc nai.....
          
          but just let me tell , even in this 6-7 months , you know kaisa hai sab mere side se...feelings have grown more....and ou image is still intact...and i love you....and somehow i feel you still do too....
          
          so just teel me na atleast this, still you have feelings for me ???
            
            and believe , ye sab hazaar puch chuka hounga ab tk....or par yeh site aj k liye hi hai...</p>
